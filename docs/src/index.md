Hi! I'm Marc, and Connaxio is my consulting, electronics, software and automation business.

I launched [Espoir](/espoir/hardware/), the open source, PoE+, ESP32-based devboard with a mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup> socket, [on CrowdSupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/connaxio/espoir) in Fall 2022, as well as a few other mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup>-compatible boards. The boards can also be purchased [at Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/manufacturer/connaxio/), their development files are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Connaxio), and their full documentation can be accessed through the left-side menu on this website.

I also play around with self-hosted services, for work and for fun. I use recycled hardware to run a Proxmox VE server that hosts a few containers and virtual machines. They provide me with a few quality-of-life services, such as file sync and backup, media streaming, home automation, and VPN. It has a simple global dashboard ([homepage](https://github.com/benphelps/homepage)) that I make available [here](https://homepage.connaxio.com).

You can reach out to me for consulting opportunities via [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d8726c56a944281c), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-antoine-lalonde-86390b123), or email, at: hello@connaxio.com.
