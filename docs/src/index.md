Hi! I'm Marc, and Connaxio is my consulting, electronics, software and automation business.

I launched [Espoir](/espoir/hardware/), the PoE+, mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup> devboard based on the ESP32 on [CrowdSupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/connaxio/espoir) in Fall 2022, as well as a few other mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup>-compatible boards. The boards can also be purchased on [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/manufacturer/connaxio/), and their full documentation can be accessed through the left-side menu on this website.

I am also available for consulting opportunities via [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d8726c56a944281c) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-antoine-lalonde-86390b123), or you can reach out to me directly: hello (at) connaxio (dot) com.
