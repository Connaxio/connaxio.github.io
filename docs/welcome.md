Hi! I'm Marc, I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, and Connaxio is my consulting, electronics, software and automation business. 

I launched [Espoir](./espoir/hardware.md), the open source, PoE+, ESP32-based devboard with a mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup> socket, [on CrowdSupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/connaxio/espoir) in Fall 2022, along with a few other mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup>-compatible boards. The boards can also be purchased [at Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/manufacturer/connaxio/), their development files are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Connaxio), and their full documentation can be accessed through the left-side menu on this website.

Need help with your project? I enjoy projects that involve solving a specific problem with a multidisciplinary / systems engineering approach. Some of the things I have done include:

- Design and build a multicopter drone from the ground up, including frame design, propulsion system, electrical systems, photography and mapping system;
- Design and build a quantum magnetic field sensor for a CubeSat;
- Design and build a greenhouse climate control system;
- Setup and run a web server with multiple services, including file storage and synchronisation, email server, VPN, media streaming;
- Program and operate a real-time image and video capture, streaming, display, and feature detection application;
- Automate appliances inside a house (well, an appartment really);
- Run a small PCB assembly operation;
- Build devices and furniture with 3D printers and wood.
