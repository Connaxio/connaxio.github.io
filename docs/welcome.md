Hi! I'm Marc, I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, and Connaxio is my consulting, electronics, software and automation business. 

I can [build a multicopter surveillance drone from the ground up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zyCprUIOgnvf1YR6cMXQhwMnOUxkF_uD/view), design a quantum magnetic field sensor for a CubeSat, run a web server with data redundancy for various services, create multithreaded software with or without a graphical user interface, setup and manage secure networks, and build stuff with 3D printers and wood. Generally speaking, I enjoy solving problems by creating simple and elegant solutions with a multidisciplinary / systems engineering approach.

I launched [Espoir](./espoir/hardware.md), the open source, PoE+, ESP32-based devboard with a mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup> socket, [on CrowdSupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/connaxio/espoir) in Fall 2022, along with a few other mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup>-compatible boards. The boards can also be purchased [at Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/manufacturer/connaxio/), their development files are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Connaxio), and their full documentation can be accessed through the left-side menu on this website.
