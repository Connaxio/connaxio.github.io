Hi! I'm Marc, I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, and Connaxio is my consulting, electronics, software and automation business. 

I know how to build a multicopter drone from the ground up, design a quantum magnetic field sensor for a CubeSat, run a web server with data redundancy for various services, create multithreaded software with a graphical user interface, setup and manage networks, and run a 3D printer. What I enjoy doing the most is solving problems by creating simple and elegant solutions with a multidisciplinary / systems engineering approach.

I launched [Espoir](./espoir/hardware.md), the open source, PoE+, ESP32-based devboard with a mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup> socket, [on CrowdSupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/connaxio/espoir) in Fall 2022, along with a few other mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup>-compatible boards. The boards can also be purchased [at Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/manufacturer/connaxio/), their development files are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Connaxio), and their full documentation can be accessed through the left-side menu on this website.

I also play around with self-hosted services, for work and for fun. I currently use recycled hardware to run a Proxmox VE virtualization server that runs containers and virtual machines. They provide me with a few quality-of-life web services, such as file sync and backup, media streaming, home automation, and VPN. It has a simple global dashboard ([homepage](https://github.com/benphelps/homepage)) that I make available for demonstration [here](https://homepage.connaxio.com).
