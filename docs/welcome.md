Hi! I'm Marc, I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, and Connaxio is my consulting, electronics, software and automation business. 

I launched [Espoir](./espoir/hardware.md), the open source, PoE+, ESP32-based devboard with a mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup> socket, [on CrowdSupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/connaxio/espoir) in Fall 2022. Their development files are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Connaxio), and their full documentation can be accessed through the left-side menu on this website.

I specialize in solutions for small businesses. Areas I can help with include:

- Climate control: Check out [Jordan's mushroom farm](https://www.westcoastfungi.farm/) in Lion's Bay, created with Connaxio's [CO<sub>2</sub> sensor](https://www.connaxio.com/projects/co2_sensor/);
- Process control: Hardware and software for small-scale process automation;
- Smart homes and other "smart" and "Internet of things" devices and appliances automation and configuration;
- Software automation: transfer data from one program or online service to another, using tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) or more complex custom scripts;
- Website and other web services hosting;
- Local network infrastructure and administration;
- Drones: pretty much anything to do with them.
